    <p id="description"> The Welsh Corgi is a small type of herding dog that originated in Wales. Sometimes just known as a Corgi, two separate breeds are recognised: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. Adaptable and loving with the whole family, Corgis can fit into just about any household, whether it’s an apartment or large home with a yard. However, they do have quite a bit of energy for a small dog. They’ll need plenty of walks and active play sessions. You might be surprised by how quickly these short-legged pups can move! For humans who can meet the breed’s needs, he will make an excellent family companion, even for novice pet parents.
